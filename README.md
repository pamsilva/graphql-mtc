## SQLAlchemy, Graphene and Flask

This project aims to combine SQLAlchemy `automap` and ORM, Graphene and Flask to expose a database from an old project I've worked on a few years ago. I also want to experiment with a bunch of libraries and tools that might help me handle and expose this data to a front-end application.


### Notes

The column names are in Portuguese, so they might look a bit odd for those that do not speak Portuguese.


#### Next steps

- deal with the encoding from the databsae.
- inspect mozilla's lib `react-jsonschema-form`, and think about the best way to introduce that here
