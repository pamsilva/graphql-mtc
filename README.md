## SQLAlchemy, Graphene and Flask

This project aime to combine the power of SQLAlchemy `automap` and ORM, Graphene and Flask to expose a database from an old project I've worked on a few years ago. I also want to experiment and tinker with a bunch of libraries and tools that might help me handle and expose this data on a front-end.

### Notes

The column names are in Portuguese.

#### Next steps

- deal with the encoding from the databsae.
- inspect mozilla's lib `react-jsonschema-form`, and think about the best way to introduce that here

## References

I inspired my self from [here](http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/tutorial/) to come up with the base Flask and Graphene server.
